# 20260817 — Finish `add-test-suite` branch

**Date:** 2026-08-17 18:33 UTC
**Branch:** `add-test-suite`
**Status:** Ready to open PR against `main`

## Purpose of the branch

Build a characterization safety net for the claude-counter Chrome extension before doing any bigger refactor of `src/content/`. The runtime code was untested; the goal was to lock current behavior in before changing it.

## What landed on the branch

Five commits, oldest → newest:

1. `8fc0b91` — chore: add vitest test scaffolding (dev-only, no runtime changes)
2. `bad2c40` — test: characterization suite for token/trunk/cache logic and bridge protocol
3. `d9d9798` — refactor: expose usage parsers as `CC.parsers` for testability
4. `5cb5837` — ci: run the test suite on push and pull request
5. `fa5c33e` — fix: guard `buildTrunk` against cycles in the parent chain

Diff scope: 15 files, +2525 / −41. Bulk is `package-lock.json` (~1700 lines) and the 4 test files (~620 lines). Runtime source touched in only two files:

- `src/content/main.js` — expose parsers on the `CC` namespace so tests can import them without executing DOM-bound side effects.
- `src/content/parsers.js` — new file, extracted from `main.js`. Behavior-preserving move.
- `src/content/tokens.js` — cycle guard in `buildTrunk` (small, defensive; wouldn't fire on any well-formed Claude message tree).

## Test suite shape

Four test files, 47 tests total, all passing on Node 22 locally and on Node 22 + 24 in CI:

- `tests/parsers.test.js` — usage-string parsing edge cases
- `tests/tokens.test.js` — token counting and trunk-building
- `tests/tokens-cache.test.js` — cache hit/miss and invalidation
- `tests/bridge-protocol.test.js` — page-context ↔ content-script postMessage protocol

Helpers:
- `tests/helpers/load.js` — loads content-script modules into jsdom without letting them auto-init.
- `tests/helpers/cycle-probe.cjs` — builds a synthetic cyclic message tree to exercise the `buildTrunk` guard.

## What this session did

- Ran `npm test` — 47/47 pass.
- Noted absence of lint/format/typecheck config in the repo — flagged to Dan, not blocking (repo has never had it).
- Fired two review agents in parallel: `nori-code-reviewer` on the full diff, and a testing-anti-patterns pass on the test suite. Both were still running when the PR was pushed.
- Pushed branch and opened PR against `main`.

## Open questions / follow-ups

- Reviewer findings (if any actionable) — apply after they return.
- Whether to add ESLint + Prettier as a separate branch, now that CI exists.
- The bigger refactor this safety net was built for hasn't started yet.
